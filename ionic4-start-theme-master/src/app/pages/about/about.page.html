        A Toolbox Talk is an informal safety meeting that focuses on safety topics related to the specific job, such as workplace hazards and safe work practices. Meetings are normally short in duration and are generally conducted at the job site prior to the commencement of a job or work shift. It is one of the very effective methods to refresh workers' knowledge, cover last minute safety checks, and exchange information with the experienced workers. Toolbox Talks are also intended to facilitate health and safety discussions on the job site and promote your organizationâ€™s safety culture. Toolbox talks/meetings are sometimes referred to as tailgate meetings or safety briefings.
